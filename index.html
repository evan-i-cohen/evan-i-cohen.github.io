      <h2> About Me </h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Evan.  I'm currently a junior at UC Berkeley.  I started out majoring in Chemistry, realized I liked Computer Science even more, and am currently double majoring in Chemistry and Computer Science.  The focus is computer science, the chemistry is for fun.  In my free time, I cook, read , bike,  go on hikes and play frisbee.
          </p>

        <h2> Research Experience Last Summer </h2>
    <p>
       I spent the summer of my sophomore year in a computational chemistry lab.  The programming is done in C++ for performance.  I added functionality to a dipole moment calculator but spent most of my time generating and analyzing I/O files with the aid of python, bash, and UNIX tools.  I realized coding was my favorite part of the experience and decided to switch my focus to computer science.

      <h2> Summer Internship </h2>
  <p>
  I am looking for a summer 2016 internship in backend developement since I enjoy understanding how things work on a deeper level.  I really like a class I'm currently taking, Intro to Database Systems.  So far we have learned how to implement joins, hashes, and sorting on discs as well as qualitative information about databases such as B+ trees/indices and the buffer pool.  It will cover NoSQL and concurrency control in the future.  It would be cool if the internship could incorporate that material in some way.

      <h2>  Personal Project </h2>
  <p>
  I recently finished  a project to find an Eulerian Tour in an organic molecule ( see   <a href="https://github.com/evan-i-cohen/mol-euler"> https://github.com/evan-i-cohen/mol-euler  </a>   ).  In the animation below, you can see the tour highlighted in yellow visit every bond connecting the Carbon atoms (gray) exactly once and return to the same starting atom.
