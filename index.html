  <h2> About Me </h2>
  <p>
  Hi, I'm Evan.  I'm currently a junior at UC Berkeley.  I started out majoring in Chemistry, realized I liked Computer Science even more, and am currently double majoring in Chemistry and Computer Science.  The focus is computer science, the chemistry is for fun.  In my free time, I cook, read ( mostly sci-fi, fantasy, and non-fiction), bike, and occasionally go on hikes and play frisbee.  I also try to teach myself some computer science related material outside of class.  For example, I am currently learning Haskell when I find the time --I suspect it will take  at least another 6 months to develop a basic proficiency. 
  <h2> Summer Internship </h2>
  I am looking for a summer 2016 internship in backend developement since I really like understanding how things work on a deeper level.  My favorite computer science class is one I'm currently taking, Intro to Database Systems.  So far we have learned how to implement SQL queries and how databases hash & sort data.  It also covers NoSQL.  It would be cool if the internship could incorporate that material in some way.

  <h2>  About This Website </h2>
  <p>
  This website is constantly evolving.  I taught myself some HTML and am working my way through CSS.  I was told by a friend to look into Bootstrap to make this site work on mobile devices.  In the future, I might try learning a framework like Django and turning this into an interactive blog but for now, I'm keeping it 1990s simple.
