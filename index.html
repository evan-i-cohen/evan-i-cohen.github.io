      <h2> About Me </h2>
      <p>
         &#9; Hi, I'm Evan.  I'm currently a junior at UC Berkeley.  I started out majoring in Chemistry, realized I liked Computer Science even more, and am currently double majoring in Chemistry and Computer Science.  The focus is computer science, the chemistry is for fun.  In my free time, I cook, read ( mostly sci-fi, fantasy, and non-fiction), bike, and occasionally go on hikes and play frisbee.  I also try to teach myself some computer science related material outside of class.  For example, I am currently learning Haskell when I find the time --I suspect it will take  at least another 6 months to develop a basic proficiency.

        <h2> Story of My Previous Research Experiences </h2>
    <p>
      &#9; I spent the summer of my freshman year working in a physical chemistry lab.  I wasn't that good at labwork so I ended up writing a Java plugin for ImageJ to track and analyze the intensity of fluorescent quantum dots over time.  
       After deciding wet labwork wasn't for me, I spent the summer of my sophomore year in a computational chemistry lab.  The programming is done in C++ for performance.  I added functionality to a dipole moment calculator but spent most of my time generating and analyzing I/O files with the aid of python and bash.  I improved my UNIX skills and now feel comfortable with tools like ssh, bash, grep, and screen, vim , and aliasing.  I realized coding was my favorite part of these experiences and decided to double major in CS and apply to internships. Not too difficult, since I was already getting a CS minor and a major is only 3 extra classes.

      <h2> Summer Internship </h2>
  <p>
  &#9; I am looking for a summer 2016 internship in backend developement since I really like understanding how things work on a deeper level.  I really like a class I'm currently taking, Intro to Database Systems.  So far we have learned how to implement optimized SQL queries, hashing, and sorting on discs.  It will cover NoSQL and concurrency control in the future.  It would be cool if the internship could incorporate that material in some way.

      <h2>  About This Website </h2>
  <p>
  &#9; This website is constantly evolving.  I taught myself some HTML and  a little Boostrap. In the future, I might try showcasing some of my projects.  I am currently working on a project to find an Eulerian Tour in an organic molecule ( see   <a href="https://github.com/evan-i-cohen/mol-euler"> https://github.com/evan-i-cohen/mol-euler  </a>   ).
