      <h2> About Me </h2>
      <p>
         &#x09; Hi, I'm Evan.  I'm currently a junior at UC Berkeley.  I started out majoring in Chemistry, realized I liked Computer Science even more, and am currently double majoring in Chemistry and Computer Science.  The focus is computer science, the chemistry is for fun.  In my free time, I cook, read , bike, and occasionally go on hikes and play frisbee.  I  each myself computer science related material outside of class.  For example, I am currently teaching myself Haskell -- it's a fun language.

        <h2> Story of My Previous Research Experiences </h2>
    <p>
      &#x09;  I spent the summer of my sophomore year in a computational chemistry lab.  The programming is done in C++ for performance.  I added functionality to a dipole moment calculator but spent most of my time generating and analyzing I/O files with the aid of python and bash.  I improved my UNIX skills since I had to use tools like ssh, bash, grep, screen, vim , and aliasing.  I realized coding was my favorite part of the experiences and decided to swtich my focus to computer science.

      <h2> Summer Internship </h2>
  <p>
  &#x09; I am looking for a summer 2016 internship in backend developement since I enjoy understanding how things work on a deeper level.  I really like a class I'm currently taking, Intro to Database Systems.  So far we have learned how to implement joins, hashes,  and sorting on discs.  It will cover NoSQL and concurrency control in the future.  It would be cool if the internship could incorporate that material in some way.

      <h2>  Personal Project </h2>
  <p>
  &#x09;   I am currently working on a project to find an Eulerian Tour in an organic molecule ( see   <a href="https://github.com/evan-i-cohen/mol-euler"> https://github.com/evan-i-cohen/mol-euler  </a>   ).  It wouldn't be too difficult but I have to use the open-babel library to represent the molecule and it is not able to simply convert a molecule into a graph.
