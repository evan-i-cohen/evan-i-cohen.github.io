  <h2> About Me </h2>
  <p>
  Hi, I'm Evan.  I'm currently a junior at UC Berkeley.  I started out majoring in Chemistry, realized I liked Computer Science even more, and am currently double majoring in Chemistry and Computer Science.  The focus is computer science, the chemistry is for fun.  In my free time, I cook, read ( mostly sci-fi, fantasy, and non-fiction), bike, and occasionally go on hikes and play frisbee.  I also try to teach myself some computer science related material outside of class.  For example, I am currently learning Haskell when I find the time --I suspect it will take  at least another 6 months to develop a basic proficiency. 
  <h2> Summer Internship </h2>
  I am looking for a summer 2016 internship in backend developement since I really like understanding how things work on a deeper level.  I really like a class I'm currently taking, Intro to Database Systems.  So far we have learned how to implement SQL queries and how databases hash & sort data.  It will covers NoSQL in the future.  It would be cool if the internship could incorporate that material in some way.  
  </p> 
  <h2> Story of My Previous Research Experiences </h2>
  <p>
      I spent the summer of my freshman year working in a physical chemistry lab.  I wasn't that good at labwork so I ended up writing a Java plugin for ImageJ to track and analyze the intensity of fluorescent quantum dots over time.  
       After deciding wet labwork wasn't for me, I spent the summer of my sophomore year in a computational chemistry lab.  The programming is done in C++ for performance.  I added functionality to a dipole moment calculator but spent most of my time generating and analyzing I/O files with the aid of python and bash.  I improved my UNIX skills and now feel comfortable with tools like ssh, bash, grep, and screen.  I realized coding was my favorite part of these experiences and decided to double major in CS and apply to internships. Not too difficult, since I was already getting a CS minor and a major is only 3 extra classes.
  <h2>  About This Website </h2>
  <p>
  This website is constantly evolving.  I taught myself some HTML and am working my way through CSS.  I was told by a friend to look into Bootstrap.  In the future, I might try learning a framework like Django and turning this into an interactive blog showcasing some of my project but for now, I'm keeping it 1990s simple.
